## Data availability:
Raw sequences are available on the public NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) as part of the BioProject PRJNA69302.
The intermediate data files are too big to be stored on Github and are hence published separately on Zenodo (see separate repository locations below).

## Abstract
Aquatic microbial communities and dissolved organic matter (DOM) exhibit complex, bidirectional interactions within hydrological networks. Despite advances in high-resolution characterisation techniques, disentangling active from passive components in these assemblages remains a challenge. We developed a novel framework using flow-weighted water age to model microbial and DOM movement along a large hydrological network encompassing soils, streams, rivers, reservoirs, and lakes across two years and two seasons. We identified distinct spatial patterns of reactive microbial and DOM moieties that consistently increase, decline, or show local peaks in abundance with water age. Approximately 7.5\% and 44\% of microbial and DOM assemblages, respectively, were statistically reactive within the watershed. Correlations between reactive members of both assemblages allowed us to discern potentially causal relationships beyond mere correlation. We observed both DOM influence on microbes and microbial impact on the DOM pool, including selective DOM consumption, microbial DOM transformation, and accumulation of microbially derived DOM. Many of these interactions have been hypothesized and some observed experimentally, but seldom identified in ambient ecosystems. This study offers new insights into the dynamic co-assembly of microbes and DOM, providing a framework for future research on processes governing these interactions at the watershed scale.
